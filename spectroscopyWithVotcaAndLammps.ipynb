For this mapping we need to create an input file, the *mapping file*. This file tells VOTCA which geometry to use for different types of calculations. As an example, for a QM calculation on acetone we can't use the distorted MD geometry, because it won't be close to the ground state geometry of the molecule and hence give a weird energy value. Hence we need to replace the MD geometry by the QM groundstate geometry. To use the QM geometry for the QM calculation we map the QM geometry of the molecule on the MD geometry.\n",

Hence the first MD atom is mapped to the first QM atom etc. The colon `:` notation is used to provide a bit more info. In the `qmatoms` tags we have `atomID:atomType` in the `mdatoms` tag we have `resID:atomType:atomID`.
